# Simple PATRICIA Trie

*Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric*

This is a simple implementation of a PATRICIA Trie. Some operations such as `remove()`, `entrySet()`, `keySet()` and `values()` run in O(n) time and are maybe not 100% up to Java's spec for the `Map` interface. This is a tradeoff to keep the implementation very simple, lightweight and extensible.

For a more complete implementation see my other PATRICIA Trie under http://github.com/rkapsi/patricia-trie.
